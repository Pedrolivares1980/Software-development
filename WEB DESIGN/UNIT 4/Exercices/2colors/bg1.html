    <h1>The Shining</h1> 
        <p>The Shining is a 1980 psychological horror film produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick<br>
        and co-written with novelist Diane Johnson. The film is based on Stephen King's 1977 novel of the same name.<br>
        The film's central character is Jack Torrance, an aspiring writer and recovering alcoholic who accepts<br>
        a position as the off-season caretaker of the isolated historic Overlook Hotel in the Colorado Rockies,<br>
        with his wife, Wendy Torrance, and young son, Danny Torrance. Danny is gifted with psychic abilities<br>
        named "shining". After a winter storm leaves the Torrances snowbound, Jack's sanity deteriorates due to<br>
        the influence of the supernatural forces that inhabit the hotel.<br>
        Production took place almost exclusively at EMI Elstree Studios, with sets based on real locations.<br>
        Kubrick often worked with a small crew, which allowed him to do many takes, sometimes to the exhaustion<br>
        of the actors and staff. The new Steadicam mount was used to shoot several scenes, giving the film an innovative <br>
        and immersive look and feel. There has been much speculation about the meanings and actions in the film <br>
        because of inconsistencies, ambiguities, symbolism, and differences from the book.<br>
        The film was released in the United States on May 23, 1980, and in the United Kingdom on October 2 by Warner Bros. <br>
        There were several versions for theatrical releases, each of which was cut shorter than the preceding cut; <br>
        about 27 minutes was cut in total. Reactions to the film at the time of its release were mixed; <br>
        Stephen King criticized the film due to its deviations from the novel. The film received two controversial nominations <br>
        at the Razziesâ€”Worst Director and Worst Actress. Critical response to the film has since become more favorable.<br>
        In 2012, The Shining was ranked the 75th greatest film of all time in the Sight & Sound directors' poll. <br>
        In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress<br>
        as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". Thirty-nine years after the original film, <br>
        a sequel, Doctor Sleep, was released on November 8, 2019.</p>
