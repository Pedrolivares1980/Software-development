                Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a team sport played <br>
                between two teams of 11 players who primarily use their feet to propel a ball around <br>
                a rectangular field called a pitch. The objective of the game is to score more goals <br>
                than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed <br>
                goal defended by the opposing team. Traditionally, the game has been played over two <br>
                45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million <br>
                players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is considered the world's most <br>
                popular and widely-used sport.
