                <h2>Heroes del Silencio, the band</h2>
                <p>Héroes del Silencio (sometimes abbreviated to Héroes or by their initials HDS) was a Spanish rock <br>
                band based in Zaragoza, initially formed by Juan Valdivia (lead guitar) and Enrique Bunbury (vocals and rhythm guitar), <br>
                and completed by Joaquín Cardiel (bass) and Pedro Andreu (drums), in the mid-1980s.
                <br>
                <br>
                They began to get together to play in pubs in 1984, but it was not until 1985 that the group took <br>
                its definitive form. Their musical discoverer was the guitarist of the Spanish band Ole-Ole.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 1987 they signed their first record contract and the following year they released their first album, <br>
                a 4-song LP. In 1988 they released "El mar no cesa", obtaining an unexpected success, ending their fame <br>
                in 1990 with "Senderos de traición". The band from Zaragoza sells half a million records and performs very <br>
                successful concerts in Germany, Italy, Belgium, Holland and obviously Spain.
                <br>
                <br>
                Then comes "El espíritu del vino" (1993), where there is a much more rocker change in their music due to the <br>
                production of Phil Manzanera, throwing off their fans, but gaining the respect of the critics. As soon as the <br>
                album was released, they embarked on the "El Camino del Exceso" tour, which would take them through Europe <br>
                and America with a total of 134 concerts, and incorporated the Mexican guitarist Alan Boguslavsky as second guitarist.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 1995 they released their fourth studio album, "Avalancha", and toured Europe for more than four months. <br>
                The relationship between the members of the band was not going well, even before recording "Avalancha", <br>
                so they released their live album, called "Para Siempre", as a farewell.<br>
                Before concluding the tour "Tour Avalancha" and in a press conference held in Lima, Héroes del Silencio <br>
                announced their temporary separation.
                <br>
                <br>
                The success of Héroes del Silencio did not cease in spite of their separation, and that is why in the years <br>
                after their breakup they continued to release albums (compilations, rarities, etc.).
                <br>
                <br>
                In 2005, the band's first DVD was released along with a CD called "El ruido y la furia" (The noise and the fury), <br>
                which compiles the best versions of their classic songs.<br>
                <br>
                In 2007, after 11 years of separation, the band reunites again to perform 10 concerts in stadiums in Argentina, <br>
                Mexico, Guatemala and Spain, among other countries. This tour was recorded in video and audio and from it <br>
                "Héroes del Silencio Tour 2007" is edited, in Cd, Cd+Dvd and special box version.<br>
                <br>
                In November 2011 the Dvd "Live in Germany" is released; it is a concert that the band gave in Germany in 1993, on <br>
                the occasion of the presentation of the emblematic album "El espíritu del vino". The material was released in Cd, <br>
                Cd+Dvd and Dvd+Vinyl.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 2015 Héroes del Silencio reissued the album "Senderos de Traición", 25 years after its original release.<br>
                <br>
                In January 2021 the album "El Espíritu del vino" was re-released 28 years after its release, becoming No. 1 <br>
                in sales in Spain. On April 23, the band premieres a documentary on their artistic career on Netflix.
